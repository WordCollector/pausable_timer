![CI](https://github.com/llucax/pausable_timer/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/llucax/pausable_timer/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/llucax/pausable_timer)

A [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
[timer](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-async/Timer/Timer.html) that can be
paused, resumed and reset.

## Example

```dart
import 'package:pausable_timer/pausable_timer.dart';

void main() async {
  print('Create a timer that fires in 1 second, but it is not started yet');
  final timer = PausableTimer(Duration(seconds: 1), () => print('Fired!'));
  print('So we start it');
  timer.start();

  print('And wait 1/2 second...');
  await Future<void>.delayed(timer.duration ~/ 2);
  print('Not yet fired, still 1/2 second to go!');

  print('We can pause it now');
  timer.pause();

  // When paused, time can pass but the timer won't be fired
  print('And we wait a whole second...');
  await Future<void>.delayed(timer.duration);
  print("But our timer doesn't care while it's paused");
  print('It will still wait for ${timer.duration - timer.elapsed} after '
      "it's started again");

  print('So we start it again');
  timer.start();
  print('And wait for 1/2 second again, it should have fired when we are done');
  await Future<void>.delayed(timer.duration ~/ 2);
  print('And we are done, "Fired!" should be up there ðŸ‘†');
  print('Now our timer completed ${timer.tick} tick');

  print('We can reset it if we want to use it again');
  timer.reset();
  print('We have to start it again after the reset because it was not running');
  timer.start();
  print('Now we wait a whole second in one go...');
  await Future<void>.delayed(timer.duration);
  print('And we are done, so you should see "Fired!" up there again ðŸ‘†');
  print('Now the timer has ${timer.tick} ticks');

  print('We can reset it and start it again');
  timer.reset();
  timer.start();

  print('And you can cancel it too, so it will not fire again');
  timer.cancel();
  print("After a timer is cancelled, it can't be used again");
  print('But important information can still be retrieved:');
  print('duration: ${timer.duration}');
  print('elapsed: ${timer.elapsed}');
  print('tick: ${timer.tick}');
  print('isPaused: ${timer.isPaused}');
  print('isActive: ${timer.isActive}');
  print('isExpired: ${timer.isExpired}');
  print('isCancelled: ${timer.isCancelled}');
}
```

## Development

### Git Hooks

This repository provides some useful Git hooks to make sure new commits have
some basic health.

The hooks are provided in the `.githooks/` directory and can be easily used by
configuring git to use this directory for hooks instead of the default
`.git/hooks/`:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

So far there is a hook to prevent commits with the `WIP` word in the message to
be pushed, and one hook to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before
a new commit is created. The later can take some time, but it can be easily
disabled temporarily by using `git commit --no-verify` if you are, for example,
just changing the README file or amending a commit message.
