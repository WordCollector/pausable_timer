## 0.2.0+1

- Fix minimum dart SDK version (use a final release, not a pre-release).

**NOTE:** Unless critical issues are found, this release will be released as
1.0.0 with no other changes since it has been pretty stable for a while now,
and no API breaking changes are expected for a long while either.

## 0.2.0

- Bump dependencies.

**NOTE:** Due to a wrongly specified minimum dart SDK version, this version was
never published in pub.dev.

## 0.2.0-nullsafety.0

- Make package [null-safe](https://dart.dev/null-safety).

  **NOTE:** This means the minimum supported Dart version has been bumped to 2.12.

## 0.1.0+2

- Add example implementing a pausable countdown.

## 0.1.0+1

- Add build status and sponsorship badges.

## 0.1.0
